Here's your step-by-step testing guide:

  Testing Phase 1 in Unity                                                                                                                                                                               
   
  Step 1: Open Unity and Let Scripts Compile                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                             
  1. Open Unity Hub and open the LostSouls project
  2. Wait for Unity to import all scripts (you'll see a progress bar)
  3. If there are any compilation errors, check the Console window (Window > General > Console)

  Step 2: Generate Prefabs

  1. In Unity's top menu, click Lost Souls > Generate Placeholder Prefabs
  2. You should see a message in the Console: "Placeholder prefabs generated successfully!"
  3. Check Assets/Prefabs/Tiles/ - you should see FloorTile, WallTile, ExitTile
  4. Check Assets/Prefabs/Characters/ - you should see Explorer

  Step 3: Setup the Game Scene

  1. Open the SampleScene (or create a new scene)
  2. Delete any default objects (like the default cube)
  3. Click Lost Souls > Setup Game Scene in the menu
  4. This creates: GameManager, GridManager, LevelLoader, and configures the camera

  Step 4: Add Debug Input

  1. In the Hierarchy, select the GameManager object
  2. Click Add Component and add DebugInput
  3. Make sure "Show Debug Info" is checked

  Step 5: Play Test

  1. Press Play
  2. The level should load automatically (3x3 grid with exit in corner)
  3. Use these controls:
    - Arrow Keys / WASD: Move one tile
    - Q / E: Rotate left/right
    - Space: Pathfind to exit automatically
    - R: Restart level

  Expected Results (Checklist)

  - 3x3 grid appears with grey floor tiles
  - Green exit tile visible at position (2,2)
  - Blue capsule character spawns at position (0,0)
  - Arrow keys move character one tile at a time
  - Character cannot walk through walls (test with level 2)
  - Pressing Space makes character pathfind to exit
  - When character reaches exit, Console shows "Level Complete!"
  - Camera follows character movement

  Step 6: Test Level 2 (Wall Pathfinding)

  1. In the GameManager component in Inspector, find Current Level Id
  2. Or modify GameManager.cs Start() to load level 2: LoadLevel(2)
  3. Press Play - you should see a 5x5 grid with walls
  4. Press Space - character should pathfind around the walls to reach exit
